This project is mainly focused on creating a machine learning model to cluster actual NBA players into 4 different groups according to the data provided of the first month and a half of competition. The idea is to classify the players for their efficiency on court in order to give interesting insights about players on a contract ending year, which will allow General Managers to seek for the best fits for their team needs and salary cap conditions. Furthermore, I have trained a regression model to predict the average minutes of a random player following their average stat line up to date. Finally, I have developed some EDA to discover interesting patterns and tendencies along the different groups of players provided by the model.
